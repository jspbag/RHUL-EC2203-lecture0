## EC2203 

EC2203 (Autumn) introduces you to **regression analysis**, a core method used by economists to provide **quantitative** answers to questions from the worlds of business and government policy 

EC2203 covers both the **statistical theory** of regression analysis, and the **implementation** of regression analysis using the statistical software R

## EC2203 learning objectives

- Understand the statistical properties of the linear regression model

- be able to formulate hypothesis in the context of the linear regression model and carry out statistical tests

- be able to manipulate datasets using R

- be able to apply linear regression using R

- be able to interpret regression output from R

## Plan

- Introducing R and RStudio

- Review of probability and statistics

- Causality

- The simple linear regression model

- Multiple linear regression model

- Further topics in regression analysis

## Assessement (Autumn term material)

- Final exam (20%)

- Graded homework (10% + 10%)

  Monday Nov 9, 2020
  
  Monday Nov 30, 2020

- Online quizzes (10%)

## R and RStudio

R is an **open source** programming language for statistical computing and graphics

R is widely used in academia and in the worlds of business and government

RStudio is a development environment for R
